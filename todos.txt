todos for converting to <DoenetML>

fix setActivityAsCompleted in ActivityViewer

Do we do anything with the PageViewer generatedVariantCallback?
If not, should just remove it

in php, change activityId to doenetId
in php, change cidForActivity to activityCid

X in core, change cidForActivity to activityCid


Why are we JSON.stringifying lastDoenetMLFromProps on line 404 of ActivityViewer?
I removed it to make it
      cid = await cidFromText(lastDoenetMLFromProps);
Is that going to cause problems?


check that pageDoenetML used to calculate cid for embeded pages has right doenetML slice

check attributeRanges for open or self-close, with or without value



test:
- <page><text>hello</text> <text>there</text></page>
- editor with viewer
  - activity variants
  - update button disabling
  - errors and warnings
  - errors and warnings in children not showing up in main editor (at least in most cases)
- links
  - placement exam links go to the right place
  - public editor links go to public editor
- ref with activityId, and deprecated doenetId
  

Determine a way to pass down the scollable container into <DoenetML>
and implement for each case where call it

find all places where assume old structure of compiled activity
(with content and an initial order)
and fix
(This might be complete)

more ignore errors from children?

apiURLs or functions


More general: selectMultiple inline choiceinput needs help

if load in activity data from database/local storage, activity specific errors won't be in error object
